# NuMFor: Numeric Modern Fortran

The goal of this project is to create a Fortran library similar to [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org)/[Scipy](https://www.scipy.org) for scientific computing.

This library consists (will consist) of several modules to ease the scientific work. It aims to provide user-friendly utilities and relatively-efficient routines for scientific computing, numerical and related work.

It provides:
  + A Submodule @subpage utils with basic, non-specific, functionality used in many (most?) scientific programming.

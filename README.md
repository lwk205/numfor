# NuMFor: Numeric Modern Fortran

This library consists of several modules to ease the scientific work. It aims to provide utilities for simple computing, numerical and related.

It provides:

  + A small framework to use strings in a simple and modern way. It consists of:
    - A module **strings**, with functions to manipulate `character` variables. Documented in \ref modstrings
    - A module **fString**, with a new type (`fStr`) to represent strings. Documented in \ref modfstring
	
	Both modules provide similar functionality, and where posible they are implemented in the same code.

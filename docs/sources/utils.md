# Utils {#utils}

The module utils defines several objects (types, constants and routines) convenient for common tasks in programming.

It consists of several areas:

  * Basic support (basic types, error handling, timer) is provided by @subpage modbasic.

  * Manipulation of strings is provided in two different "flavors":
      * A "procedural" approach is provided by the functions and subroutines in the @subpage modstrings
      * An "object-oriented" framework is used in the @subpage modfstring
